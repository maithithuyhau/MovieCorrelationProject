#Movie Correlation in Python
This project uses Python to analyze a dataset of movies and find correlations between different variables, such as the movie's budget, votes, and gross.

##Data Source
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies. It includes information about over 5,000 movies, including their title, genre, release year, rating, budget, votes, and gross.

##Dependencies
This project requires Python 3 and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
These can be installed using Anaconda

## Usage
To run the project, simply download the dataset and the Python script and run the script using a Python interpreter. The script will read in the data from the CSV file and perform various analyses and visualizations.

## Inconlusion
This project can be used by movie studios and production companies to understand the relationship between different attributes of a movie and how they can impact the success of a film. Additionally, this project provides a foundation for future work in the movie industry, such as predicting the success of a movie based on its attributes.
